"""
Palindrome Permutation:  Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.  A palindrome
is a rearrangement of letters.  The palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards.
A permutation is a rearrangement of letters.  The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
You can ignore casing and non-letter characters.

Input:  Tact Coa
Output:  True (permutations:  "taco cat", "atco cta", etc.)
